At a Rally in Bethesda today there were calls on the government to do more to tackle what is being called the 'housing crisis' throughout the countryside.

According to the Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which organized the event as part of a series of rallies 'Nid yyd Cymru ar verle', the government needs to do much more in different areas related to housing.

People from all over Wales had gathered there to draw attention to the case.

In response, the Welsh Government said they were taking action and that "people should have access to a decent, affordable home to buy or rent in their own communities so they can live and work locally."

'The housing market is failing communities'
Well over 150 people of all ages marched through the streets of Bethesda on Saturday.

Among them was Owain Meirion, the new Chairman of Cymdeithas yr Iaith and he was of the opinion that there is "not enough affordable housing for local people".

"'We know there are communities in Bethesda and across Wales... the housing market has failed them... there are not enough affordable houses for local people to buy or rent, the housing market has failed them.

"The call today is for the government to do more, that there is a big increase in the number of houses that are in public ownership and the specific call today is for more houses in community ownership."

He added that "the government needs to take a more proactive role in restoring that social housing stock and give support to communities through legislation and through money to create more community initiatives".
